# Banking-Domain
 Banking Domain Analysis By Gender Matrix.
 

Project Overview

This project provides an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a banking client and transaction dataset, with a specific focus on identifying, quantifying, and visualizing performance and behavior differences across gender.

The primary goal is to surface actionable insights related to credit, savings, and loan products to help a financial institution refine its risk models, tailor marketing strategies, and promote financial equity.

🎯 Key Objectives

Client Segmentation: Analyze the distribution of customers (age, district, income) by gender.

Product Adoption: Compare the penetration rates of key products (Savings Accounts, Credit Cards, Loans) between male and female clients.

Credit & Risk Assessment: Evaluate key risk metrics (e.g., Loan Default Rates, Portfolio at Risk - PAR) broken down by gender.

Transaction Behavior: Analyze typical transaction patterns, average balances, and spending habits to understand gender-specific financial engagement.

Actionable Recommendations: Provide data-driven suggestions for product development and equitable lending practices.
